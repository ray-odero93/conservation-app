    <h1>GET TO KNOW ME</h1>
       <h2>What matters most to you in leadership, in your work, and in life? </h2>
          <p>I have always believed that leadership is more about leading yourself first before you can lead others. I always ask myself, if I were someone else, would I follow my lead? What matters most to me is being able to first satisfy my own irreducible minimums of leadership before I can present myself to the rest of the world as a potential leader. Even in my work and life in general, I want to be able to have confidence in myself before I can give others the chance to have confidence in me. In summary, I want to lead by example, to be the change I want to see.</p>
           <br><p>Words that describe me?</p><ul>
                <li>Fun</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>What do you value?</h2>
           <P> More than anything, I value individual responsibility. I believe people should take change as an individual responsibility before they can assign that responsibility to someone else.</P>
             <br><p>What i expect from others.</p><ul>
               <li>respect</li>
              </ul>
         <h2>What are you unwilling to compromise?</h2>
            <P>I refuse to believe that trends cannot be unlearned. Change is inevitable when its pursuit is intentional and growth is certain when people are willing to learn and/or change.</P>

     <ol>
       <li>I am qualified, in every way, to be a voice of reason to the circumstances and people around me despite the challenges that come with it.</li>
       <li>I am qualified, in every way, to be a voice of reason to the circumstances and people around me despite the challenges that come with it.</li>
       <li>I am worthy of being listened to, despite my age, gender, race or financial standing, and my opinions are valid.</li>
       <li>I am powerful enough to determine who I am and what I stand for, and I should never compromise on these two things.</li>
       <li>I am an example to someone, whether knowingly or unknowingly, and I therefore owe it to them to be the best version of myself in everything that I do.</li> 
      <li>I am an example to someone, whether knowingly or unknowingly, and I therefore owe it to them to be the best version of myself in everything that I do.</li> 
    <li>I am a force to reckon with, and I will speak for the voiceless, stand for those who cannot stand for themselves and lift others up, just as it has been done for me.</li>
